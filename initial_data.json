Major findings include that it is possible to change currently channeling funds of the UN\r\nfor humanitarian aid and directly investing in the private sector and through creating debt less funding\r\nmechanism. One method is creating inclusive global markets and by enabling Somalia's markets with the\r\nprivate investments of both local and international investments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have a solid research background in which extensively researched on relief, recovery , and\r\ndevelopment-related interventions in Somalia including Somaliland. Major researched issues include\r\nresearching drivers of social, economic and political instabilities of Somalia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, have effectively contributed the development of a relevant monitoring and evaluation\r\nframeworks. As the result, produced number of locally applicable survey instruments for qualitative and\r\nquantitative studies through household surveys, focus group discussions relating to food security, employment\r\ncreation, health, and education interventions.Due to 10 years of experience, I have developed new threshold\r\nthat addresses major drivers of such protracted violent conflict in Somalia. The core function of the developed\r\nthreshold is through identifying program stakeholders and creating effective linkages of such identified\r\nprogram stakeholders. Throughout my working experience, I also have documented major lessons learned on\r\npeacebuilding approaches, political economy and on sustainable local development.
